latex-homework-template
=======================

[Adjusted] LaTeX file I use for math/CS homework. Forked from [jdavis](https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template)

## Installing

1. First you'll need LaTeX. Instructions on obtaining it can be found here:
   http://latex-project.org/ftp.html
2. Compiling from the command line will look like the following:

   ```bash
   $ latexmk homework.tex
   ```
3. Or you can use [TeXShop][texshop] or a similar native client to typeset the
   LaTeX file.

## Credit

When first starting with LaTeX, I came across [this template][credit] and used
it as a base for starting my template. As you can see, it is pretty similar.
